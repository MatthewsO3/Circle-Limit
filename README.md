# Circle-Limit
Circle Limit like application in C++ using OpenGL
Description
This application is a simple OpenGL program that demonstrates the rendering of a star object with a dynamically changing texture based on Poincaré disk geometry. The star rotates and resizes based on user input. The program includes functionality for resizing the star, toggling animation, changing texture filtering, and resetting the texture dimensions.

Features
Rendering of a star object with dynamically changing texture based on Poincaré disk geometry.
Ability to resize the star object.
Toggle animation of the rotating star.
Change texture filtering for smoother or pixelated rendering.
Reset the texture dimensions.
Controls
Press 'h' to decrease the size of the star.
Press 'H' to increase the size of the star.
Press 'a' to toggle animation of the rotating star.
Press 't' to set texture filtering to nearest neighbor.
Press 'T' to set texture filtering to linear.
Press 'r' to increase the texture dimensions.
Press 'R' to decrease the texture dimensions.
Dependencies
OpenGL
GLUT
C++ Standard Library
How to Build and Run
Ensure that OpenGL and GLUT libraries are installed.
Compile the source code with a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) and link against the OpenGL and GLUT libraries.
Run the compiled executable.
